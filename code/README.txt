The two folders have code base for baseline models and the fine tuned blueBERT model for our project.

1) Baseline models:
The code was downloaded from a GitHub repository : https://github.com/nyu-mll/multiNLI 
Further additions were made to test the MedNLI dataset. 

2) BlueBERT model:
The code for the BlueBERT model and additional files for data preprocessing.
